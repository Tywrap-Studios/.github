# Hi there champs! Welcome to Tywrap Studios! 👋

- 🙋‍♀️ Who are we? Ha glad you asked! We're some friends and people trying to make some awesome development projects while having the most of fun! 🎉
- 🌈 Want to contribute? Hit me (@Tiazzz) up in our [Community Discord Server](https://discord.gg/kcm8scfCwK) via tickets and we might be able to exchange some info. 👀
- ❓ Wikis or docs on any of our projects would be available on the respective GitHub repo Wiki, does the project not have any? Then it should be some what easily useable from other sources such as the project page or self-explanatory content! 👍
